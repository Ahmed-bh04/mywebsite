            <h1>Summary of our work</h1>
            <p>Our website is an excellent example of everything that athletes who go to the gym need. It contains many pages that contain rich and useful information, which may help athletes develop their bodies and reach the highest level of physical fitness. Our gym is called Iron Fitness, and it contains many of the necessary sports machines and equipment, in addition to the presence of trainers with a high level of professionalism. We have dedicated this website so that athletes can have a unique experience while in our gym. The website consists of 6 pages, including this page, which contains various topics such as the workout page and the food page. On our home page, there is a Register panel for the website, through which you can access information within the website. On the second page, there are different types of workouts for different body parts. Then on the third page, there are many tips to improve nutrition. After all that, the store is located on the fourth page, where we offer all the gym equipment in our store. On the fifth page, there are designs and prototypes for how to create the website. Finally, on this page, which is the last, there is the story of this project.</p>

            <h1>The challenges we faced </h1>
            <p>There are a number of situations that arose throughout the creation of the “Iron Fitness” website that were interesting and complex to solve and in some cases involved technical changes made on the site. There has always been the vanishing problem of how to achieve a uniform way of navigating across different pages. To this, care was taken to use standard HTML Tags in the formation of the overheads and the left hand navigation consequently applying uniformity across the site. While this approach created a certain amount of overlap, there was no shortage of a need for parity. Another one of which was the ability to present dynamic content, for instance a welcome message according to the user’s name. This was overcome by using the browser localStorage where the user name is stored and makes the message continually appear on all the pages without loss of data. Another issue with the workflow was the presence of embedded YouTube videos mostly due to the fact that while making the latter view did not allow maintaining the layout across devices. Although, we have put the videos within the table to avoid the issue, we realize that further changes to make them more responsive must be addressed in future. Furthermore, we decided on a minimalist and least intrusive design in order to provide the best user experience. Due to the simplicity of the layout, and color contrast we made it aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate through. Our aim is to tweak the layout with the top focus on making the site more accessible.</p>

            <h1>What we learned</h1>
            <p>Having worked on the Iron Fitness project, we drew effective knowledge in technical and team aspects of website development. Curricula wise we strengthened our Prowers in HTML, CSS and JavaScript specifically in elements like the dynamic shopping cart system. It turned out to be particularly valuable to get to implement things like storing user greetings using the localStorage in JavaScript. we also covered the aspect of user interface to respond to various devices by implementing CSS grid on the products layout. The task of keeping all pages looking nearly identical when embedded in a high level design environment along with the integration of features like product cards, buttons and modals pushed our design ability to the next level. Also, there was growth in the level of thoughts formulation, how to structure the HTML properly and the usage of CSS styles for obtaining pleasant looking but functional website. On the collaborative side we find that being part of a group project helped us realize how effective communication and coordination are important. Each team member was assigned a specific task in the creation process of the design of the homepage, not mentioning the functionality of parts of the homepage which needed a good integration; and good integration of these parts needed numerous discussions and feedbacks. It allowed us to know how to let others know about our accomplishments and the request assistance where necessary and how to address emerging disagreements. From this project we also learned something about schedule and making sure the code is readable and documented for someone else to pick up where we left off. In general, it showed us to what extent people can be helpful in reaching one shared objective, as long as they respect the principles and combine technical and teamwork abilities to develop a final outcome.</p>
