            <h2>Justification of our design </h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When we incorporate many color and specifically light colors to our web page, but in the Register or Home page we use dark color so it will be better and unique.</li><br>
                    <li>We used many tables like the table in the Workout page, so there will be many rows and specify the row with different information. </li><br>
                    <li>We used dark colors for some heading to be clear, and pages background we used light colors for better readability and easy on the user's eyes. </li><br>
                    <li>On the top right, we made the user name in cyan color to be clear to the user and also give a calm feel to the site.</li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="mockup-box">
            <h2>Justification of our code </h2>
            <p> <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML:</strong> We increase the user readability and to keep a good design, so we used the tags like head, nav and footer respectively.</li><br>
                <li><strong>CSS:</strong> We used guarantees a beautiful styling; and further refinements are very easy to implement.</li><br>
                <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Incorporation of new elements, new objects and new functions was useful to untangle and make the task for the user, easier when browsing this website.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion </h2>
            <p>
                For effective site maintenance, we chose to put all CSS design files in a separate file. We also added a separate page for JavaScript and a separate file for images, which makes it easy to maintain the site in the future.
                For ease of navigation, we have also added a web navigation bar which makes it easier for the user to navigate through the website pages.
